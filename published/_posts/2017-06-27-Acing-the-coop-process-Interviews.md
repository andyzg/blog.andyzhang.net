Over my last 4 years at the University of Waterloo, I’ve had the fortune of interviewing for dozens of companies for different intern positions such as Software Engineering, Product Designer and Product Manager. I’ve failed many, and I’ve succeeded occasionally. Along the way, I’ve built up a process of approaching interviews that has not only helped my success rate, but has also turned interviews into a fun process. This process has been exclusively tested with tech companies and may be applicable to companies in other industries.

## Understanding the goal of the interviewer
If you get an interview for a company, it means that the company’s recruiter screened your resume and thinks you have the potential to be a good candidate. The goal of the interviewer is to validate this potential. There are a few main points almost every interviewer will look for:

- Are you technically competent?
- Are you able to communicate your thought process?
- Most importantly, would I want to work with you?

Almost all interviewees overlook is the fact that interviewers are also put in a stressful situation. They’re required to make a subjective decision that can affect someone’s future career. There are studies that show that stress is contagious. No one likes to be stressed, so a secondary goal would be to not feel stressed.

Now that you have an understanding of what interviewers are looking for, let’s talk about how you can mentally prepare yourself to match these requirements.

## Mentally preparing yourself
The minutes leading up to the interview are nerve wracking. We’ve all been there. We start tapping our fingers, we start imagining all of the worst case scenarios, we start rehearsing all of the technical content we just learned, and we try to distract ourselves without much success.

Interviews. A situation where your career can be affected for better or for worst. A situation that can determine how you spend four months of your life. It’s scary. Seriously, that is terrifying and stressful.

Let’s forget all of that for a second (it’s hard, I know). Try reframing the situation. You’re about to meet someone from this amazing company, and you want to become friends with them. Meet them like as if you were meeting a new friend.

“Hey, I’m Andy. What’s your name? Nice to meet you!”

You’ve probably done this hundreds of times all of your life. Introductions are scary as well, because they’re the basis of first impressions. Smile, give them a firm handshake, and stand up straight. Just like how you would meet a new friend.

The situation shouldn’t feel stressful anymore. You’re meeting someone new, you’re getting to know them, and they are getting to know you as well. Hopefully, if the introduction went well, they already like you!

## Problem solving
At this point, they’re getting to dive into a problem to test your technical competencies. One mistake interviewees do is that they try to prove to the interviewer that they’re able to solve the problem. Although this approach works, you’re only focusing on a part of the big picture.

Instead, reframe this as a team meeting. You’re working at a company, and both you and your coworker need to solve this problem together. As the lead, you’re responsible for driving the process of solving the problem, but you also want to make sure your coworker is on the same page as well.

Keeping your coworker engaged and asking for his or her opinion for your approach is a great way to ensure that you are on the same page. For example, in a software engineering interview, if you’re not sure how to get to the solution, you can ask if X is a good approach to solving the problem.

Many will believe that asking for validation seems like a lack of confidence. However, I believe that asking does X things:
- You’re honest when you don’t know the answer. That’s a lot better than blindly brute forcing a solution, especially in a work environment
- You keep the interviewer engaged in the problem. Interviewers may zone out, so this is a great way for them to understand your approach.
- It can be a conversation starter that will help you better understand the problem. For example, they may respond with “Why do you think X is a good approach?”

When you’re not trying to ask questions or engage the interviewer, you should explain what is your thought process when solving the problem. But what does this exactly mean? It means that you should have structure when solving these kinds of problems. For example, in a software engineering interview, you can mention that you’ll first write some test cases, you’ll write the solutions, then you’ll run the test cases. When diving into the details of the solution, you can explain how each step ties into the approach you’re taking to solve the problem. The worst thing you can do is to stop talking and do nothing.

I’ve shared some of the ways I think about my thought process when I solve programming problems. These aren’t the only ways to talk through a thought process. Always keep in mind that the goal of talking through your thought process is to ensure that the interviewer is on the same page as you.

## Ending the interview
Near the end of the interview, the interviewer will cut you off to leave some time for questions. If you didn’t finish your solution, that’s fine. What’s important is that you showed to your interviewer that given more time, you would have been able to finish the solution. It’s not about the result, it’s about the process.

When the interviewer asks if you have any questions, now’s the time to ask about things you’re genuinely curious about. Try to avoid asking questions that are very broad where everyone at that company can answer. Instead, ask them specific questions that very few engineers can answer. This can be done by researching your interviewers and learning more about what they’ve done at the company. For example, what is it like to work on X team in the company? Did you ever mentor an intern? If so, what did they work on?

I also really like to ask personal questions. These can be hit or miss, but they are often things I’m very curious about. For example, what’s your favourite thing about working at X company? What’s your most memorable moment at X company?

The most important thing is that these are genuine questions. Be genuinely curious about the answers. Ask follow up questions if you have any. You should never ask questions if you’re sole purpose is to “fill in the awkward no question gap”.

Interviews are really intimidating. Like everything else, they take a lot of practice. One problem companies always face is having a lot of false positives and a lot of false negatives when hiring. The best case scenario for you and the interviewer is that you are able to do your best and that the interviewer sees your full potential. The approaches I outlined above have helped me consistently give my best in each interview, and I hope that they help you achieve your best performance at your next interview :)
