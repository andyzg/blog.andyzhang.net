Hack the North is Canada's biggest hackathon. It was started in 2014 by a small
group of passionate UWaterloo students. Last weekend, our team of
almost 40 organizers and 300 volunteers helped make Hack the North another
memorable weekend for our hackers and sponsors. We had Justin Trudeau, Prime
Minster of Canada, kick off our opening ceremonies. We also had over a thousand
hackers come from 24 countries, building some of the most mind-blowing hacks
I've ever seen.

This year was a first for me because it was my first time leading a team for
Hack the North. Leading the design team was daunting at first. Looking back, I'm
so glad I did it because it taught me how to be a better leader, and I also got
to know some really cool designers.

In this blog post, I want to share what I've learned from my
experience as a design lead, as well as how I would improve the process for
future years.

# Team building
## Approach
The goal of my team was to deliver high quality digital experiences and visual
assets that represented Hack the North's brand. In order to achieve that, I
wanted to build an awesome team. I wanted to have a team of designers work
as one, rather than have multiple designers work independently on separate
tasks.

Luckily, this felt natural to me, because I really liked every designer on the
team on a personal level. I wanted to see each one of them succeed, and be proud
of their work. I saw each designer on the team as my friend, rather than someone
who works for me.

This approach ended up working really well. Our team naturally ended up having
each other's backs. When someone needed feedback, everyone would jump in and
pitch in. When one designer wasn't available, someone else was available to help
out. Our team of five was mostly working remotely in three different timezones,
meaning that we frequently had to help each other out when someone was offline.

## Retrospect
If I were to lead again, I would want to implement more mentorship pairings
amongst the designers. This would allow younger designers to learn from more
experienced designers. Additionally, it also gives an opportunity for the
designers to build their own relationships.

# Communication
## Approach
This year, I decided to experiment with having multiple Slack channels for
different purposes. We had a #design channel, where other teams could
communicate with the design team. We also had a #design-feedback channel, where
designers could share their mockups and collect feedback from their stakeholders
or other designers.

I also had a private #early-design-feedback channel where designers
could share low fidelity or experimental work. There were frequently criticisms
on #design-feedback stating that the mockups weren't representative of Hack
the North. However, those designs were often just results of experimental ideas
which often led to confusion. As a result, I separated any experimental or low
fidelity work into #early-design-feedback channel.

Lastly, we had a #design-chat where the designers could chat with each other.
This was used to coordinate meet ups, and share any cool articles or resources
with each other.

## Retrospect
Last year, we only had a #design channel to communicate with each other. This
year, I introduced 3 new channels. Separating all design conversations into 4
channels introduced a problem where no one knew where a message was supposed to
be sent. Messages were frequently shared in the wrong channel because the
channel purpose was never clear.

More channels to follow meant that context was scattered across multiple
channels. As a result, non designers might have a hard time understanding
the full context of our tasks.

Next year, I think that 2 channels would be enough. It would allow for a very
simple pipeline:
1. Someone requests for a design in #design.
2. A designer gets assigned the task in #design.
3. The designer completes the task and shares it in #design-feedback.
4. The designer gets feedback and iterates based on the feedback.
5. The designer sends the designs on #design.

You can imagine how unnecessarily complicated our process was with 4 channels.
In fact, our two extra channels quickly became inactive, validating the fact
that they weren't as useful.

# Conclusion
I feel very lucky that the team I worked with were all people I enjoyed working
with. I wish I could say that there were some conflicts where I had a hard time
dealing with a designer and that I learned something huge from it, but it didn't
happen. I can definitely say that I still learned a ton from this whole
experience.

If I had the chance to lead the design team again next year, I'd do it in a
heartbeat. It was easily one of my favorite moments in Hack the North.
