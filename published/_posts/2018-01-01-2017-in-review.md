# Thank you 2017

What a wonderful year it has been. At the end of every year, I keep telling
myself, "Wow, this was the best year yet!" Well, I can confidently say that this
year has been the best year yet!

Here are some highlights of 2017:
- I did a design and PM internship
- I built 2 photography side projects
- I got much better at Smash
- I started investing money
- I posted 180 photos on Instagram, developed a consistent style, and bought a new Fuji X-T2
- I learned how to be more organized using Trello and Google Calendar
- I had a workout phase and managed to hit 42 double jump ropes in a row
- I got my driver's license
- I secured a full time job

Last year, I grew a lot as a person through exchange and learning from amazing
people. This year, I had the opportunity to learn new skills thanks to friends.
It's been a wonderful year, and I'm excited for 2018, my final year of
university!
