In less than a year, I’m going to be set free into the wild. No more classes scheduled onto my weekdays, no more exams on terribly timed evenings. Most of all, no more constant pressure of finding an internship.

As I grow up, I wanted to find the confidence in being a worthy full time designer. I’ve always been hard on myself, pushing what I’m capable of. Transitioning into design has been one of my long time achievements. When I first learned I received my offer for Quora’s Product Design internship, I was ecstatic. But I realized this was the beginning of a hard journey.

Fast forward a couple of months, I’ve yet to feel confident in finding a full time design job. Is this what I am really meant to do full time? If so, how do I get there? What’s the best way to get from my current state to a full time design job?

There’s an exciting and hard journey ahead of me. Just like you and everyone around us, I’m also working towards a certain goal. This blog is meant to keep me accountable. To document progress and process, to gather feedback and thoughts, and to visualize my improvement.

Some of my future plans include documenting different processes in all different parts of life, tutorials, or lessons learned. I’m excited to share my progress with you. On this day one, we’re miles away from the goal. So I hope to keep myself accountable, and continue sharing what I learn at each step.

Lastly, why write on a blog? There are tons of other ways that allow me to document my progress. The main reason is because writing is a process for organizing my thoughts. One of my biggest problems is that my thoughts aren’t close to being organized. Writing will force me to structure my thoughts better, and hopefully improve how I organize my thoughts in day to day situations.
