<h1>And so a new coop term begins...</h1>
<p>My term so far has been absolutely fantastic. Well, apart from the misadventures with the airplanes. We can skip that part.</p>
<p>There couldn't have been a better way to kick off a new year with a Google Orientation Week. We went through several talks about Google, its values, the teams and everything Googley.</p>
<p>More importantly, I had the pleasure of meeting many awesome people and create friendships with other fellow interns. We had an amazing time at Googleplex, going from one building to another, from the eastmost buildings to the westmost, and to top it off, free food!</p>
<p>But heck, we didn't really settle with just free food. We decided to indulge ourselves in the diversity, and ate 2 meals per meal. That means 2 breakfasts, 2 lunches and 2 dinners.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit. We did this on certain occasions, enough to be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>And during each one of our breaks, we chose to move in style. That's right, walking ain't cool, we rode GBikes all over campus. It's really convenient since it only takes at most 10 minutes to go from one side to another, plus a couple of calories.</p>
<p>On the evenings, we'd relax, enjoy the luxury of the hotel provided by Google. Our suite had a heated toilet, and a television installed in the mirror. Now that's fancy!</p>
<p>I went to San Francisco on Thursday evening to meet up with some of my classmates and upper year softies. We had a great dinner at Raddish, a restaurant on 19th and Lexington. My expectations were low and they were definitely exceeded by the tenderness of the fried chicken they served.</p>
<p>Friday night ended like a blast, with several games of resistance. On the morning of Saturday, we shared our good byes as well as wishing each other the best of luck for our internships at Google.</p>
<p>When I got to the airport, it came to my attention that my flight was delayed by 7 HOURS. Well, that's no fun. Luckily, I had several friends flying in from Toronto that day so I waited at their terminals and bumped into my classmate as well as my old roommate at Facebook. I grabbed lunch with my old roommate and caught up on stuff. And that topped off my amazing week in California :)</p>
