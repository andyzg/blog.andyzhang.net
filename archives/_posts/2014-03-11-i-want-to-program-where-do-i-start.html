<p>No one's born a programmer in this world. Nor are they born a musician, a dancer.... you get the point. Truth is, you become one. But since you aren't born as one, there exists a t from [0, now] such that f(t) = 0 where f(t) is your knowledge and experience in programming. So how do we start getting a positive slope?</p>

<p>Before I talk about how to start, here's my story. Hopefully, it can provide some insight along with key points. In November 2012, I didn't even know what a programmer was. I didn't know that there existed people who started programming as a kid. My first line of code started off at my school's robotics team. I wanted to learn something new and I asked to take the role of the robot programmer. And so I did.</p>
<p>Key point here: <strong>A desire to learn.</strong></p>
<p>But I didn't know anything. So my curiosity drove me to start searching up how to do a simple task, also known as a "Hello World" task. A "Hello World" example is essentially the simplest task in a field. Example: In Mathematics, Hello World would be 1+1=1 whereas in English, it would be Hi! My name is Andy. After I find some resources as to where to start, I started reading.</p>
<p>Key point here: <strong>If you want to learn, you need to actively seek resources and guidance.</strong></p>
<p>This meant I read how to setup my first IDE and writing my first basic program. After compiling a basic program, I examined what it did. By manipulating some of the values, I could associate what value does what. Slowly, by combining all of this knowledge, I combined all of this knowledge into a larger program. One way to see it is that you're learning how to use each LEGO piece and how it should be used and what's the best time to use it. With all of this knowledge you've accumulated, you can slowly start applying it.</p>
<p>Key point here: <strong>If you learn something, either apply it or forget it.</strong></p>
<p>Using these 3 past points, after dozens of iterations, I slowly managed to understand coding logic and managed to pull off a solid placement at my Robotics competition. And then I decided to start learning more languages on my own? This is how I would start.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How I learned programming</span></strong></p>
<p>I loved my first experience programming. I immediately had a desire to learn more and wanted to build something bigger, better, cooler, awesomer! I started off by going on www.codeacademy.com and did at least half of their lessons including all of their Web Design ones. After accumulating all of this experience, I was able to say I knew some code. But here's the problem. If I just tell you the properties of wood and then give you a hammer, some nails and a bunch of wood and ask you to build me something, would you be able to?</p>
<p>Chances are, the first time you try, it won't be as nice as you'd have hoped. Applying knowledge is just as important as learning it which is why I would emphasize applying the knowledge you've accumulated. How did I apply my knowledge? As I was learning web development, I made a website using HTML, CSS, JQuery that calculates are RScore(Quebec grading system) and then determines which Universities you have the academic requirements for. I wanted to find out what options I had with my grades so I decided "Hey, I need something to automate the process of checking what I can get into. Let's build something for it!"</p>
<p>So when you start, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be passionate</span> about your idea. Be motivated. Keep working on it and searching up on Google for solutions to your problems. And before you know it, you'll have completed your first project!</p>
<p>However, web development isn't for everyone. Are you someone who loves algorithms? You spend nights thinking about sophisticated problems? If this sounds like you, I would recommend www.projecteuler.net. Â This is where I first started learning about algorithms and was intrigued about the different ways to optimize approaches to problems. If you're currently a high school student in Canada, I would recommend asking your school about CCC, the Canadian Computing Contest. It is hosted annually by the University of Waterloo and it is a great experience for those who love hard problems.</p>
<p>What if you love building stuff though? You want to build the next Facebook? If this sounds like you, you should look into Software Development. Making a simple website as mentioned in my experience is a great example of where to start. There are so many ways to do this and there's no better way. Some suggestions include web applications, Java applets, Android Applications, iOS applications, Windows Applications or even a Google Extension! It might seem intimidating at first but if you just start off by googling "How do I build X?", you'd be surprised how many people had the same problem as you.</p>
<p>Overall, getting past this initial barrier of intimidation is definitely scary but when you actually get started, you'll realize that programming isn't just about sitting all day coding on your computer or hacking into security systems but rather building awesome software or improving today's technology. I hope this post has somewhat given you an idea where to start. Good luck!</p>
