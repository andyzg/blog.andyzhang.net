<p>First semester's already almost over and it's been one hell of an adventure. University is nothing like high school or college and I can finally understand why they say it's hard.</p>

<p>At University of Waterloo, Software Engineering is known to be a competitive program. This isn't just a rumour but rather a truth. Practically everyone is extremely smart in their own way and really motivated to do well at school. Truth is, it goes to the extent of rushing to class for the front seat at least 15 minutes before class. Despite the competitiveness, everyone is really supportive which balances out. Everyone is humble and iswilling to help any time you ask questions. This not only applies to the class but also to upper years. I've approached many upper years with questions and they take their time to answer them.</p>
<p>When I think about it, I did work a lot everyday. Each week, we would get 4 assignments, 1 lab report every 2 weeks and 2 quizzes a week. We also get 4 SE 101 quizzes that are worth as much as midterms over the term and we get to work with the Scribbler robot(not the best) for a team project. In terms of course content, it is fairly simple before the midterms. Most of it is high school review and there are barely any new concepts for most students. After midterms, it's a wake up call for everyone because most people realize that they're no longer the best in their class. Think about it, you have 150 people with 90+ averages put into a class that should have an average of ~75-80. There will be 60s and there will be failures.</p>
<p>There was ECE 105(Mechanics and Waves) Â that most people were freaked out about. To be honest, it wasn't that bad. As long as you understand the concepts and know how to draw free body diagram and some math, you're more than fine.</p>
<p>ECE 140(Linear Circuits) was fairly simple except when you do complex numbers. I remember being fairly confused but as you slowly start understanding complex numbers, the concepts become more clear and consequently, so does the course.</p>
<p>Math 115 was honestly a pain for me because I wasn't a big fan of Linear Algebra. I know that the general consensus is that it's not such a bad course. A quiz a week, an assignment a week, most people stay up to date with the content</p>
<p>Math 117(Calculus), it's probably the easiest course for 1A. Mostly just review for me, nothing new.</p>
<p>CS 137 was a pretty cool course and you get solid practice with pointers and addresses if you weren't familiar with them before University. I never coded in C and I thought it was a great introduction.</p>
<p>SE 101 is a class where you're taught stuff related to engineering including professional conduct, coop, etc. And Scribbler. The amount of painful hours on that :(</p>
<p>My favourite part of Software Engineering has nothing to do with the academical aspects of it. I just love the environment. Over the term, I've worked on many projects such as designing a UI for Workathon, a Google Extension to block websites, and Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, a super large version of tic tac toe on Android(we learned this game during Orientation Week) and currently, we're working on UWallet, an Android app that lets Waterloo students keep track of their money on their Watcard. I get to work with awesome people who are extremely knowledgeable and get to learn a lot. I would almost say that I came to this program for the environment but that isn't true. There's co-op :)</p>
<p>Starting next term, all of my academic terms will have a coop process, meaning I will have to search for my own jobs on Jobmine(soon to be WaterlooWorks) and attend interviews. I am really hoping to get a good development job that can teach me a lot. If there was one company I'd really love to work for for first coop term, it would be Shopify because it's near Montreal and it seems to be a company where interns are given hard problems to solve, meaning I can learn more. Otherwise, I would settle for any decent dev job because I would already be lucky that I have a job related to my field of study, let alone a QA job.</p>
<p>There are lots of tiny details I wish I could discuss about Waterloo but I guess I should save that for another post. Writing at 3am was never something I was able to do.</p>
<p>Good night world.</p>
