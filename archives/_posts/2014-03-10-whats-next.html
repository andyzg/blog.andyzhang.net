<p>Oh hey there Internet! Didn't see you there.</p>
<p>I'm super excited for my awesome summer this year at Facebook. It's going to BE A W E S O M E. But before that, I've got some other things going on, maybe just as exciting.</p>
<p>My team and I have gotten solid progress on the framework we've been working on. We've decided to call it Onepanel where our mobile devices will unify all of the provided services around you. I've been working on the Android component but unfortunately, due to school work, haven't gotten much progress.</p>
<p>In 2 weeks, I'm going to be headed to the National Business and Technology Conference. I think it's going to be a ton of fun and I'm really looking forward to it. My friend Kevin Shi had an awesome crowdfunder idea and we decided to apply last minute. Best of all is that it was free due to Waterloo subsidies!... That's probably the reason why we went.</p>
<p>Anyways, the week after, I'm going to participate in hack Waterloo. It seems like it's going to be a lot of fun and I'm really looking forward to hack a new project! I'm actually a huge fan of hackathons and each previous hackathon I've been to, I've had an amazing experience in terms of both learning and fun. My team and I are still unsure what we'll be building but I'm sure that with whatever idea we tackle, we'll make sure it's freaking awesome.</p>
<p>It's been quite the busy semester and I can see my grades suffering consequently. Day by day, I'm realizing that I'm more and more behind on school work and I have made no effort whatsoever to catch up. The material is getting much harder and I'm having a bit of difficulty to understand it all. Luckily, this makes sure that the content is hard which is something I like because I hate it when things are easy. It's just so boring.</p>
<p>Another thing is a summer resolution. This summer, I've decided to start contributing more to open source. Where to start? I'm thinking about ReactJS but it all depends. Being at Facebook means having the help of everyone around me and since ReactJS was made by Facebook, I can easily ask some employees to introduce me to the library and help me get started. I'm also thinking of getting back in shape. After the past few months, I've realized I'm struggling to do more than 15 pushups whereas I had no problem getting past 30 in the past. Must start working now.</p>
<p>I should also sleep soon. Night world!</p>
