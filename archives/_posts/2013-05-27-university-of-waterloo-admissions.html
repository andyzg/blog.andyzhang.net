<p>Ah yes, I still remember the days when I was freaking out about my application to University of Waterloo. It only became my goal in September 2012 when a friend who's currently attending it told me to join him. After doing my research, I was quite surprised with all of the stats I saw.</p>

<p>So what convinced me to apply for Waterloo? First of all, it has connections with employers all over the world. How many ? Over 4800 and that's more than enough to impress me. It also has an amazing campus with friendly people from all over the world. Each building has a sick design and it's definitely a nice experience. There is a really nice study environment there and I do think this will have an impact on my studies when I will be studying there.</p>
<p>So when the time came to apply, I was super nervous. I went on the OUAC website and applied for the 105D application. I had to make an account, fill in all of the required data and pay a total of 215$. Many might think that 215$ is a lot and it's not worth applying but think of it this way. With 215$, you can apply to many different programs through OUAC and it will just give open another door for you when it's time for you to choose where you want to go to University. I've known people who applied conservatively and they do regret not maximizing their options. If you have the grades, why not ?</p>
<p>After finishing up my application on OUAC, I received an email containing the information for my Quest account. This was one of the most nerve racking moments of my life because I knew my writing wasn't well and that was all they were going to see. I remember investing over 3 weeks on the AIF, making sure everything was the way I wanted it to be and that it was genuine. After all, I want them to accept me, not a fake me.</p>
<p>I felt pretty confident when I was filling out the section that asked me what I did on my free time. I am pretty involved in general, being on the student council, rowing team, exec of several clubs, robotics team, orchestra etc. I knew that I would stand out there and if ever I got admitted, it was because of these activities.</p>
<p>I also got the chance to talk about my awards. That was an awkward moment because at the time, I didn't have many awards and I felt like if I haven't accomplished anything, it would greatly undermine my application. Nevertheless, I filled out whatever I achieved in the past and went straight to the next section.</p>
<p>There is a specific section for people who applied to Engineering and they ask you why you want to study Engineering. I remember describing my experience with the Robotics team and the whole process of brainstorming and building a robot and how I loved it. After that, it asks you to talk about an article or a book that you liked. I talked about the student from Dawson College who hacked the Omnivox system and got kicked out of school for that.</p>
<p>After the stressful 3 weeks of AIF writing, submitting it was a HUGE relief. It felt good knowing that nothing could be changed here on out but it was really stressful knowing that an unknown answer was on its way to me in less than 5 months.</p>
<p>In the end, I received an answer in the beginning of March. I was extremely happy, calling my mom right after I got my answer and posted it as a Facebook status. It's a great feeling knowing that a University wants you to study at their school :)</p>
