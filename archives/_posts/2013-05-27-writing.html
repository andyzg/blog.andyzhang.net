<p>While I was on my way back to Montreal from Toronto, I was browsing through my phone and saw a really interesting article on LinkedIn about writing. I learned that writing is a formalized way of thinking. Now I know for a fact that no one is going to go to their teacher and tell them that they're going to practice their thinking because that is just plain weird. But the fact that there exists a correlation between the way you write and the way you think motivated me to start this blog.</p>
<p>So yes, I am going to be writing quite a bit in order to "practice how I think" and I'll share my thoughts with whoever bumps into this blog. It'll consist mainly about University of Waterloo, technology, coding, algorithms and puzzles. And yes, these are the few things that I am passionate about so if you have any questions or you just want to have a conversation about one of these things, feel free to message me !</p>
