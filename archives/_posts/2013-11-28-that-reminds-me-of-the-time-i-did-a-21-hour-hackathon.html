<p>Hello World,</p>
<p>This hour reminds of me of the time I was at a 21 hour hackathon.</p>
<p>Oh yes, EngHack. My team and I won 2nd place for that with our app called UWallet and it felt good to have accomplished something over the night. And day.</p>
<p>At the start, you feel driven, motivated, ambitious for a new product that is useful for the world. You start writing code like a monster, writing and writing. You are a machine. You get stuff done and you tackle part by part. Then morning hits. It's about 3:00am and you start losing focus. Caffeine wears out and you are stuck on the same error for 1 hour. True story, I spent 2 just to realize I forgot to add my event listener. What even..</p>
<p>But you reach a certain point where your body just wakes up again aka you were supposed to wake up. You start working again and you can see a good progress. You feel less tired because you're getting used to it.And then, time started passing so slowly and I was really unconscious of anything I was doing. Oh man, those were some unproductive hours. I still remember trying to fix a couple of bugs but overall, I took it easy. I managed to get a view nicer so that our app could display the transaction history properly. Efficiency was definitely not there though.</p>
<p>I'm tired now though. Good night world.</p>
