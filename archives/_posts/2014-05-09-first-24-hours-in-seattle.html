<p>Leaving home for co-op was a huge step for me. Not only was I going to live in the United States for the next 4 months but I'll have to be more independent than ever! Before my trip, I had to get all of my documents organized and it was really stressful knowing that each document was crucial.</p>
<p>I arrived at Seattle at 11:00pm last night. I was really exhausted since it was 2:00am eastern time but when I got to my corporate housing, I suddenly woke up. As I walked into my apartment, I felt like I just stepped into heaven. Each bedroom was like a hotel room, my kitchen was filled with utensils, pots, plates, bowls, cups, everything! It even had 2 grocery bags with some food!</p>
<p>But what blew my mind even more was the rooftop. There was a really cozy atmosphere in the upstairs lounge and the patio has sofas and seats and even a TV! There's also a beautiful dining table with 2 barbeques, perfect for small parties. Downstairs, there's also a movie room. There's sofas everywhere in the room and a TV larger than anything you've ever seen! I spent my afternoon watching Game 4 Habs vs Bruins there(but unfortunately, we lost).</p>
<p>In the morning, I went to a nearby cafe called Bacco cafe. It was really small and cozy and I ate a classic benedict. I find the Benedict extremely delicious and it's starting to become a favourite for me during breakfast hours.</p>
<p>As for supper, I had some Vietnamese food, literally 2 doors away from my apartment building with my roommate, Amir. It was fairly good, nothing outstanding in my opinion.</p>
<p>Regardless, I'm super happy about this first 24 hours and I just can't wait to get started with Facebook work :)</p>
