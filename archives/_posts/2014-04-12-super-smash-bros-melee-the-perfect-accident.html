<p>It's already been over 12 years since the release of the game and I still play it. On a weekly basis. But really, why am I playing this game which has so many new versions? What is it that makes this game so special?</p>

<p>Truth is, I think this game is more than just a game. It's a symbol. It brings people together from all cultural backgrounds, age, gender(gradually...) and sexuality. Never have I ever seen a community so diverse where everyone is super friendly. This is something I appreciate more than anything else which is why I love this game so much.</p>
<p>I remember when I first started to play this game, it was with my neighbors. We would get together every week and play hours and hours non stop. It never got boring. Why? Because it's a piece of art.</p>
<p>It's a game that gives you so much control over your character that it truly immerses you into the game. Each different match composes of a different experience, different combos. You'll never find 2 matches that are identical. What's even more awesome about this game is the amount of mind games that can be played. Here's an example.</p>
<p>Let's say that I know you're at a high percentage and I only need 1 more hit to kill you. I know you're going to start playing defensively so you will either start backing out more or shield more etc. Since I have this knowledge, I can adapt to grab more which cannot be blocked by your shield or potentially preict where you'll run and attack you there in advance so that when you're there, I can hit you immediately.</p>
<p>There's all these tiny little details that really make this game fun and it's really something easy to pick up by anybody. By learning a couple of buttons, one can easily learn the game and perform the same tricks I would be able to do after 5 years.</p>
<p>No one's at a disadvantage when playing this game which is why it's so fun for everybody.</p>
<p>But here's my favourite aspect about this game: it doesn't support internet. Today, games are so dependent on the internet that it's disgusting. People play alone in their rooms, typing all of their thoguhts rather than expressing them verbally. Where's the social element in that type of gaming? I always thought gaming was where people get together and have fun playing the same game, not distance themselves and type out their thoughts while staying up till 3 am playing all alone in their room.</p>
<p>Smash is a reason why people get together and it's hard to say no to it because it's so fun. It's a party game, it's a competitive game, it's a social game, it's a freaking awesome game too. I really think that this is the ideal game out there and game designers should start learning from what made Super Smash such a successful game.</p>
