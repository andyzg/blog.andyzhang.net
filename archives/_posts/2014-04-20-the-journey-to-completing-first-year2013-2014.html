<p><strong>January 2013</strong></p>
<p>I just barely started learning some programming. Bought Java for Dummies book, read it and did a bunch of practice problems on Project Euler. Waterloo Software Engineering was my first choice. After relentless research on studentawards.com, I knew that that was the program I wanted to be in for my University studies. I spent 2 weeks writing my AIF, making sure that it encapsulated who I am and why I'm a strong candidate for the program.</p>
<p><strong>February 2013</strong></p>
<p>I submitted my AIF. Later this month, I competed in the Canadian Robotics Competition. During the day of the Programming Competition, our robot broke down and I thought I was doomed. I needed a win to gain credibility for programming in my AIF. With an hour left, I remember kicking everything around me to release all my frustration. After emptying that out, I spent the last 30 minutes debugging my code. If only I had known what clean coding was or efficient shortcuts, I would have been able to easily debug that in 10 minutes... Well, those were definitely the most rewarding 30 minutes of my life. I ended up with 1st place in the Progamming Competition(truth is, I never got to test my new code. I was pretty darn happy).</p>
<p><strong>March 2013</strong></p>
<p>I was in Forever 21, hanging around downtown when I received an email from a Waterloo Admissions Officer. I just got my offer. It was one of the best days of my life. This was also the month when I started my first project after completing CodeAcademy lessons, a static website that allows users to enter their grades and based on the input, I would display programs from Quebec Universities that they had the academic requirements for. It would've been really useful if I had known what web scraping was at the time.... Yes, all the data was manually entered.</p>
<p><strong>April 2013 - May 2013</strong></p>
<p>I finished up my finals. Finished my website and also started a new website using PHP.</p>
<p><strong>Summer 2013</strong></p>
<p>I gave up on that project. Why? This was the last official summer of my life, might as well enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>September 2013 - December 2013</strong></p>
<p>How'd I start my semester? Meeting all of my classmates was a blast. From the start, I decided to build some cool projects and got some friends to tag along. We decided to build Ultimate Tic Tac Toe for Android. During class, I used my laptop to take notes.</p>
<p>Later on in the semester, I got into Employer Info Session. I thought these were awesome because of the free food. Just kidding, I loved getting the chance to talk to the recruiters and seeing what the companies do. This gave me some solid background knowledge on each company's culture and what they look for in interns.</p>
<p>I also decided to grab every opportunity I had to hack something. I went to both SE Hackday. The first one, I worked on the User Interface of a Google Extension my friend worked on at UofT Hacks. It allows users to block websites during set times. The next one, my team and I finalized our Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game.</p>
<p>We also had the chance to participate in EngHack, my first official Hackathon! It was plenty of fun and my team and I built UWallet, an Android Application that pulls data from Watcard servers and stores them locally on the mobile device. This led us to winning 2nd place, an amazing achievement for my teammates and I.</p>
<p>This semester was ordinary and I was just getting the hang of University.</p>
<p><strong>January 2014 - April 2014</strong></p>
<p>Over Christmas, I built my own personal website. It's not mobile friendly unfortunately but it's pretty unique. I built it using simple HTML/CSS and JQuery with some neat JQuery plugins. I also crafted a resume that would allow me to stand out among the other applicants.</p>
<p>As first semester started, my first two weeks were normal. I spent most of my time trying to craft my resume by asking upper years. After these two weeks, that's when things started getting hectic.</p>
<p>I started off by going to MHacks, my first Hackathon in US. It wasn't the greatest experience but I do think I learned a lot. It was my first time working with NodeJS, AngularJS, MongoDB and ExpressJS(MEAN stack) and I was working alone. Using Bootstrap, I built a website from scratch including the registration system using this stack. It was extremely complicated and I wasn't very proud of my work despite the lack of manpower and time. I learned that no matter what, teamwork will always do better than independent work.</p>
<p>The weekend after was the Waterloo Facebook Hackathon. I already had a team and an idea but no plans for execution. We split the tasks evenly and everything was well organized. Except I had trouble setting up the BluetoothServerSocket on the Android Application for the longest time(5 hours). By the time that was all done, I had to test it with the PC client. Oh, who would've known, apparently, some Python libraries on Ubuntu were broken. This took us 2 hours to discover and I ended up testing this on my windows machine. It ended up working fine on mine so we ended up having the weirdest set up where I was constantly pulling his code to test while I was also writing my Android application. By the 10th hour, we had a working prototype and the rest of the time, we polished it, built a UI on Android, adding more features.</p>
<p>By the end of the Hackathon, we were completely exhausted. I was so tired, I felt sick, and I'm sure my teammates too. Our demo pitch was decent. Turns out, it was more than decent. When announcing the winners, who would've known my team would have won! We were told to contact the recruiter(he's really awesome) to set up interviews with Facebook and then we called it a night.</p>
<p>Later on, I had my tsunami of interviews. Each day, I would receive an email or two for interviews. My biggest interviews were Khan Academy, LinkedIn, Thinking Ape and Facebook. I had a total of 25. I was really glad my resume crafting paid off and I started getting the hang of interviews. By the time it was almost reading week, I remember having 10 interviews, 1 lab, 2 midterms, 2 assignments in a week. Call me weak, but I was pretty scared. I clearly remember Wednesday being my big day, having Thinking Ape, Kaleidescape, Tagged, ContextLogic and Facebook interview. By night time, I was having dinner for a friend's birthday and then that's when I got my call. I clearly remember the emotions boiled up in myself as I was talking on the phone and when I was told I got my internship, I think I almost shed a tear of happiness. After getting back to the table, I couldn't breathe, numb of excitement and happiness.</p>
<p>The following days, I had an awesome time. Especially almost failing my CS midterm, I literally left right after finishing, not even reviewing(never do this with actual code). I enjoyed my reading week and had a blast at Seattle. Getting to Seattle was by far one of the most stressful things in my life too. While transferring my Toronto flight to Seattle flight, I only had 10 minutes to run across the whole airport to catch my flight to Seattle. I recall it being around 1km with borders, checkin, security check in 10 minutes along with 2 heavy bags. I definitely wished I did more cardio.</p>
<p>After coming back, normalcy returned. I went back to doing my weekly assignments, reading on weekends. On 1 weekend, I did my first open source contribution to UWFlow! It was really exciting and I'd definitely recommend any new developer to check it out. The founders are by far the friendliest people I know and they are really helpful getting you set up.</p>
<p>Another weekend, I spent it at UW Apprentice Case Competition. This was a fairly interesting competition since I have no prior experience in Marketing and a lot of it ended up being marketing... Well, at least I learned new things which is definitely what I was looking forward to.</p>
<p>Another weekend was at NBTC in Toronto. My team and I pitched a Crowdfunding project with a lot of backed research crammed from the prior days. We also attended a bunch of key note speakers and one thing I definitely retained from it is that first of all, being a CEO can suck. It's a lonely job, especially in a large workplace and it doesn't matter if you get the money because you might not end up enjoying your work. The second was that anyone can say your idea is good but the truth is, if you ask your friend to invest $500 in your idea, they won't do it. Truth hurts.</p>
<p>That pretty much wraps up my life for the past year. I'm really happy with what I've accomplished and I'm really looking forward to work on amazing projects this summer at Facebook Seattle!</p>
