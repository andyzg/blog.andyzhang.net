<p>I've officially decided to continue blogging over my study term! I think it was a great habit for me to write down every one of my memories throughout the term and I'm also happy to share them with any readers.</p>

<p>Week 1 was amazing because it was Orientation Week. The start wasn't as pleasant since I had to go through an 8 hour training after arriving at 3:00AM to Waterloo because of a 7 hour flight delay. At least I made it. Following the training, I helped out with all of the move ins, seeing new friends. It felt like home.</p>
<p>As orientation week started, I got to see more and more of my fellow classmates. I've been waiting for this moment for half my summer and it's finally arrived. I was finally back with my class!</p>
<p>Throughout the week, we did a bunch of awesome activities such as built catapults out of junk as well as a sales pitch that we won, to going in mud in the rain. We also got pied in the face and got super wet after getting washed off. Overall, it was an amazing week filled with well planned activities and I couldn't have asked for a better O-Week :)</p>
<p>Throughout the evenings, we hung out with a lot of the leaders as well as only software engineering students. Having these moments with my classmates really made me realize how much I was happy to be where I was and how I wanted to do all I can to make sure we keep this amazing momentum we gained throughout the week and to make this type of get together happen more often.</p>
<p>Especially when we played Resistance. That was an amazing game, and it really got my friends going. We had an awesome time playing that game at Velocity and then at MC 4041 on my birthday. Best part of my birthday was going to the bar with everyone and telling stories about our summer, and drinking Jaeger bomb shots and beer.</p>
<p>It's been an unforgettable week, I can't wait for the next Orientation week! Cheers to an amazing term ahead of us!</p>
