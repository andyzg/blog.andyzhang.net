<p>1B, 1st wave of coop applications. It's already been 2 weeks since the hectic applications and with experience comes lessons. Here are a couple of things I learned after my first few weeks applying for coop and interviewing. (Note: These are my personal opinions, everyone has their own way of doing things)</p>

<p>1. Get a LOT of feedback on your resume. There's no further explanation needed for this other than DO NOT make any tiny mistakes in your resume. That's a mistake times X amount of applications. Even when you think there are no more mistakes, there will always be one hiding or an aspect that can be improved</p>
<p>Why do I emphasize this? After getting my resume reviewed by over 4 upper years, dozens of friends, one of my friends happens to see it and notices that I wrote November wrong. Employers probably know that you know how to spell November and this just shows carelessness for such an important document.</p>
<p>2. Make your resume EASY to read. Too many times have I seen resumes that are cluttered with information, paragraphs that are 5 lines long, non prioritized information. To make your resume easy to read, you need to minimize text while maximizing content i.e. convey a lot with few words. </p>
<p>while (dontAgree()) {</p>
<p>read(“I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.”</p>

<p>}</p>
<p>It's hard for employers to read through over 150 resumes in a day and by making yours nice and short, it can make a huge difference. Another thing to keep in mind of is that you should never underestimate the power of bullet points and indentation. They are key to organizing your information properly and making sure the reader knows what you did where. </p>
<p>3. Important information ALWAYS at the top. If I were to read your resume, I would only take 15 seconds to decide whether I'm interested or not. We naturally read top to bottom, left to right. Unless you have a specific reason why you put your international accomplishments in programming at the bottom of your second page with font size 5, then please do yourself a favour and put your highlights at the top of your front page under your name.</p>
<p>4. Cover letters. Are they really necessary to have? Some think so, others don't. I'm not a huge fan of them either since they require a lot of tailoring towards the employer. However, don't underestimate them. A good cover letter can get you pretty far. Some employers know who they want to hire before they even interview them and many times, it's because of a superb cover letter. Not to say that you should write one for every employer but rather write one for your favourite/dream companies. The last thing you want to do is have a template and replace the employer name with the one you're writing it to and the job title with the job position you're applying for etc. The employers can usually tell. </p>
<p>However, keep in mind that not all employers will read these. Do it at your own risk and make sure not to spend too much on this as you can be spending it elsewhere such as polishing your past projects or working on new ones.</p>
<p>5. The interview day. In my case, I like to arrive at least 20-30 minutes early. I like to be aware of who I'm meeting, for what company am I interviewing for, what are the job responsibilities, etc. It can be nervous for the first 20 minutes but once the atmosphere sinks in, you are more than ready to go to your interview.</p>
<p>6. The interview. When I walk into the interview, I always make sure to shake their hands. After getting seated, most of the time, they ask me about my side projects and past experiences. Make sure that you are able to talk about specifics in your past projects including difficulties, what you learned, what technologies you used, who you worked with and the current status of the project. The last thing you want to do is lie about some part in your resume. For example, if you used C++ once, do NOT say you're comfortable with it. At the very most, say you're familiar with it. Same goes for a project, if you barely contributed to a team project, do not take credit for the whole project on your resume. Not only does it make you look bad but many times, interviewers can tell if you actually worked on it or not. </p>
<p>7. Post Interview. It might have been a long day for you but you're not the only one. The interviewer has had a long day after interviewing over 5 applicants which can take over 5 hours. It's not an easy job and you should always show your appreciation for their time by sending them a thank you email and it's also a good opportunity to ask them questions you might still have regarding the job position or the company.</p>
<p>Those are all of my recommendations for now. Hope these come in handy for some of you guys, if not, good luck !</p>
<p>Later world !</p>
