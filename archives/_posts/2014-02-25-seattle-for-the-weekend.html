<p>Yesterday, I just got back from the most awesome trip ever to Seattle! Thanks to Facebook, I was able to get there and enjoy an amazing experience at their Seattle office and get to tour the city.</p>
<p>I suppose it isn't Jobmine official yet but I'm excited to say that I'll be joining the Facebook team this summer for one heck of an internship! Wooooo !</p>
<p>After touring their office, it sealed the deal. I already knew I wanted to work at Facebook but I want to say that their office is off da hookz. The food is amazing and everyone is so friendly. I learned more in depth about their projects and really enjoyed learning more about what the employees have done. Along with myself were a few other students from Computer Science, Software Engineering and Mechatronics.Â </p>
<p>I remember during my flight there, it was heavily delayed by 1h30m. I was terrified because I was going to arrive at 8:15pm but it was suppose to leave at 8:15. Thankfully, when I got there, it hadn't left yet(I even arrived at 8:35) BUT it was going to leave in 10 minutes!!! I remember running across the whole airport and crossing 2 customs while getting my picture taken, asking for directions and running through the airport without my belt and with my shoes half on along with sweat across my forehead. I arrived at exactly 8:45 and made it onto the flight. CLUTCH!!!</p>
<p>We enjoyed an amazing breakfast and lunch at the office and for dinner, we went out to a sweet restaurant called Tavolata. It was pretty damn fancy and we got to taste a bunch of awesome italian food like pasta, spaghetti, bread, meat etc.</p>
<p>The next day was optional but I would never say no to an extra day in such a beautiful city! Despite being a cloudy day, we still went out and grabbed breakfast at a restaurant called Dahlia. It had amazing food and I was STUFFED after that. We visited the pike market and Bainbridge island. I wouldn't recommend the Bainbridge island since there's actually nothing there(awkward 1 hour walking around there heh).</p>
<p>At night, we feasted on some of the best dumplings I've ever had at Din Tai Fung! Our awesome recruiter drove us to Bellevue and ate some pork buns, dumplings with chicken, pork and shrimp and even with sesame(That one was delicious!). To top it off, we had shaved ice, a royal dessert! What a nice weekend!</p>
<p>Coming back to normalcy is very depressing but it's necessary. I'm glad I had the chance to experience such an awesome weekend and I'm glad my hard work paid off!</p>
<p>Good night world!</p>
