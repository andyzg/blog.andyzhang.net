<p>After coming back from Europe, I had 3 days left before I had to leave for California. So you could imagine those 3 days were quite busy.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time studying and doing assignments, catching up on all of the work I missed as well as doing the lab we were supposed to do. As we left for the airport, I still didn't finish my CS assignment but right before I boarded the plane, I managed to submit it.</p>
<p>At California, we were welcomed by an amazing weather as well as a shining sun. We ubered down to our hotel and grabbed a nice dinner at a nearby plaza. Our meal was pretty much a king's meal, we had 3 appetizers and a humongous pho. We were pretty much spoiled.</p>
<p>At night, we had a game night where we all got together and had a chance to talk to everyone. Everyone was super cool, smart and had a lot of great ideas. It was fun talking with them.</p>
<p>The next day, we got to the Facebook HQ and it reminded me of the good times I had when I worked there. We had a quick tour of the office(more like village) and settled down on our hack stations. We started hacking at 2 that day.</p>
<p>During the hackathon, we decided to build a cooperative coding game that allows coders to solve puzzles together. This led to a lot of challenges, mainly sandboxing the code and running 2 codes simultaneously. Our demo didn't turn out as well as I had hoped but we came out with an amazing experience and a lot of fun.</p>
<p>After all of that wrapped up, we got back to our hotels and crashed for an hour. That night was a really fun night at a reserved party in Oakland. There was a bowling alley and an arcade and tons of free food. We stuffed ourselves and played all sorts of games. One of the funniest moments was when Kevin played a drop the ball game and I dropped it for him. He only ended up getting 25 tickets. Right after, I dropped the ball on my own card and won the jackpot. It was a hilarious moment. There was also a wheel of fortune where the direction you spun would move the angular velocity of the wheel in that direction. Some other hackers capitalized this and slowed down the wheel to land the jackpot. It worked 5 times in a row.</p>
<p>And then we got back to the land of Canada. It was -2 degrees and we were in a hoodie. Talk about terrible weather, I wish I was back in California.</p>
