<p>What does it matter if time travelling isn't a future prospect ? Does that mean that nothing else is ? Oh but of course not. Unfortunately, the future cannot be read in the present which leaves space for imagination.</p>
<p>What will the future technology look like ?</p>
<p>Let's start with gaming. Currently, many tech companies are searching for ways to make the gaming experience as immersive as possible. For example, Oculus Rift and Omni have developed ways to bring the gamer into the virtual world and to make the experience almost real. In not long, I am sure technology will find a way to simulate pain without having any physical effects on the body. With such technology, gamers would be able to live their character in the virtual world. People would also be able to "travel" to different environments and discover new countries. Maybe technology such as the fictional Google Nose technology will actually be invented and allow people to smell different environments aside from the one in their real life location. I'm looking forward to finding out what the future will bring us.</p>
<p>The previously mentioned technology would also be used for movies in order to make the viewer a part of the movie as if they were God. It would make sense since movies are becoming more and more realistic with the addition of 3D and moving seats at theatres. With all of the previously mentioned technology, movies cannot get any more realistic.</p>
<p>I have this impression that when holograms will be perfected, almost every device will start using it. 2 dimensional screens will no longer be of use and everyone will start working like Tony Stark in his basement. We could browse through different windows and programs by touching the hologram itself and discard it by throwing it somewhere else just like in Iron Man. I can definitely see Leap Motion making a contribution to this technology. Also, Artificial Intelligence might reach to a point where it will be able to interact with humans smoothly and even become their friend. And plus, if holograms can be easily projected, it will be so much lighter! (and therefore following the trend of smaller computers) I really hope holograms become a thing over the course of the 21st century.</p>
<p>One of the features I admire a lot about Google Glass is that sound can be heard not through the ear but by a new type of vibrating technology, meaning it will not damage your ears. Using this technology, we could revolutionize today's headsets and save our ears from any long term damages. We could listen to music using this revolutionary headset instead of having the whole Google Glass itself.</p>
<p>I'm slowly starting to get this impression that phones nowadays are becoming more and more valuable than wallets. With today's app development industry, I sense that the phone will soon become a 2 in 1. There will eventually be everything on a phone like money, bus passes, train passes, airplane tickets, passports, etc. They will easily be connected to these hologram devices, making it easier to browse through the phone. Basically, every book, document, folder will be stored in an electronic device and you would never ever need anything in your room again aside from your furnitures. What a crazy world it would be.</p>
<p>And what if all of these new technologies become a part of our lifestyle ? Would it be good ? Let's let technology decide the fate of our future lifestyle.</p>
