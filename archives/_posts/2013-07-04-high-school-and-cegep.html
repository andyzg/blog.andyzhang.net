<p>It isn't wrong for me to say that I am currently attending one of the world's most prestigious CEGEPs at the moment. In fact, it wouldn't be wrong at all to say that my CEGEP is the best in the world. Truth to be told, the only CEGEPs that exist are in Quebec and this is because we have a different education system.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of Canada, high school in Quebec consists of 5 years only starting from grade 7 to 11. Although high school is shorter, we have to attend 2 years of CEGEP which is considered as a college. Afterwards, we attend Universities just like other high school students. Now if the CEGEP graduate were to attend a Quebec University such as McGill, they would be considered as a U1 student, meaning they've skipped a year. If a high school student were to attend McGill, they would start at U0. In the end, if Quebec students continue their studies in Quebec universities, they would be studying the same amount of time as high school students. </p>
<p>There is however an issue when CEGEP students decide to pursue their studies outside of their province. Transfer credits become an issue and the curriculum is different. As a result, credits cannot be fully transferred and many courses taken in CEGEP become useless. </p>
<p>That is my current situation as a CEGEP student. I will be pursuing my university studies at University of Waterloo for Software Engineering and I will be starting off as a U0, otherwise known as a first year. I'm technically a year older in terms of education than everyone else in my program and although this gives me an advantage in terms of the first year, it also means that I will be repeating many courses I have already completed.</p>
<p>This may be a recurring situation for many so make sure to check up on the University of your choice before making a decision. Many wouldn't take the road I chose but you choose what you want to do and if you believe that you found the right program, nothing is stopping you.</p>
