<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Last few weeks have led me to a new conclusion: School gets harder and harder.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm stating the obvious here but I think it's really important to accept the fact that school does get harder. We're getting weekly assignments, 4 of them being mandatory as well as labs every other week and they aren't like first year. The assignments take longer than they used to and I tend to ask my friends a lot for help.</p>
<p>And here's why coming to Software Engineering was a great decision: I get to work with my classmates on these problems, ask them for help and try to help each other understand the concepts. This isn't something other programs have from the start, and this is why I love my program.</p>
<p>I haven't had the chance to go to many classes since I'm not feeling as well as I used to, but I've been catching up on all of my assignments and had the chance to do several interviews.</p>
<p>Speaking of interviews, last weekend, I went to the Bay Area for 5 days for a Quora interview. I first went to San Francisco and stayed at my friend's place. He went to CalHacks, so I was lucky enough to have his bed :D</p>
<p>On Saturday, I went to Union Square to buy an iPhone. Surprisingly, it only took 5 - 10 minutes before I was able to get it. Much shorter than most people, that's for sure, and I also got to spend my US money. Afterwards, I joined a friend and other Software grads at Hong Kong lounge for some dimsum. Great time overall, although I may have gotten food poisoning there :/</p>
<p>Later on, we went to Blue Grass Hardly Strictly Music Festival(free) and chilled around. We walked and talked, enjoyed some of the music(not really) and chilled on the grass. It was great talking to some upper years and learn from them(as well as talk about some Super Smash). After walking around some more, we ended up on a beach, where I practiced some photography. My pictures weren't really that great... It's okay.</p>
<p>At night, we went to Hakka restaurant near Geary Blvd. and had some good food. After that, we went to Union Square and had Karaoke there with a bunch of other Waterloo Alumni. Ton of fun :)</p>
<p>Next day was just homework.... A lot of it...</p>
<p>And then the Quora Interview. That was really hectic, it was 4 interviews in a row and I've never done anything like it. First was a practical interview where I had to debug some code given a stack trace. Afterwards, I did another interview, had some lunch and then 2 more technical interviews. It was overall a great experience, people at Quora are super nice! I'm sad that I didn't get the offer but it's fine, it's was an opportunity to test myself as well as a chance to learn more about Quora.</p>
<p>After coming back to Waterloo, it was just a ton of work to catch up on as well as a midterm on Friday. Really stressful trying to catch up on everything but hey, here I am done with everything and I don't have to worry at all anymore!.... Just kidding, I have 4 more assignments due next week. Bye now :)</p>
