<p>It's crazy to think that it has already been 4 weeks since the end of my internship! And now, I'm back to my hectic lifestyle at school, trying to do as many things as I can. Literally.</p>

<p>I've been pretty busy trying these days with a couple of small commitments everywhere, such as WEC Programming, Hackathon, as well as staying in shape. Doing exercise was something I really didn't take seriously last term and I thought I should change that this term. I have been consistently doing exercise so far and I'm really happy about that.</p>
<p>I also have quite solid progress on the organization of other stuff! The one commitment I have been slacking on was the First Year Newsletter but it's a work in progress.</p>
<p>More importantly, school is getting much harder and I have to put a lot of time into assignments. They aren't done as fast as they were in first year and the course material is also harder. It's crazy to imagine so many people went through this stage and I can completely understand why they say that engineering is such a hard program now.</p>
<p>I've also spent a lot of my time these past 2 weeks playing Super Smash Bros Melee. It's a great way for me to relax and take it easy, which is why I play it. I've gotten fairly good at the game, and I can see a big improvement compared to the last time I played.</p>
<p>That's it for now, night!</p>
