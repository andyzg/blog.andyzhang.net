<p>"Is it really worth getting LinkedIn? Why should I put effort in my LinkedIn profile? Why XYZ ?"</p>

<p>First of all, what is LinkedIn? LinkedIn is a professional social network. Each person has a neat profile page containing a resume-like page, all which are optional information. But my question is, why would you not put any information?</p>
<p>Especially as a student, I like to get noticed by employers. I want to be able to sell myself and try to impress my employers. I like to feel prepared for an interview at all times. But isn't a resume enough for this?</p>
<p>Not really. Based on my prior experience, a resume is really to give the employer a reason to meet you, not to hire you. Chances are, if you have a lot of prior experience, you will not be stuffing it into a 3 page resume. Please do not write a resume longer than 2 pages as it's just painful to read and most employers will not even reach the last page.</p>
<p>In a lot of cases, employers will want to know more because they may be very selective for their interviews. Viewing a potential employee's LinkedIn can provide a huge insight on the potential of this person. It doesn't always boil down to this situation but what if it does? I would hate to lose a chance at a job because I didn't put in effort in my LinkedIn account. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-285" alt="Untitled" src="http://andyzg.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Untitled.png" width="300" height="115" /></p>
<p>These are my statistics of who viewed my page in the last 90 days. As you can see, there's a surge during the co-op process where my profile was viewed over 30 times in less than a week. Disregard the 2nd tab that says there's only 1 viewer from the Staffer/Recruiting Industry because a lot of software recruiters are Software Engineers, not recruiters unless we're talking about a large company.  I wouldn't fully attribute this to the coop process just yet but I know that it is a factor that contributes to this surge.</p>
<p>If an employer took the time to view your profile, would you rather greet them with nothing or something? Choice is yours, my choice is definitely something because they came to look for something. I always make sure to add a bit more information on my LinkedIn page relative to my resume in order to make sure the recruiter learns something new about me. Example: A role you had in a club, a small project you worked on, your skills, etc.</p>
<p>So overall, I would strongly recommend everyone to get their LinkedIn profiles set up. I like to consider it as efficient use of time because that extra hour or two you put in your LinkedIn profile could just be the reason why you landed that awesome job of yours this summer.</p>
