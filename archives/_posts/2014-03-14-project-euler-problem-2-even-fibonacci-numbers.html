<p>"</p>
<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."</p>
<p>Doing this problem in one line seemed kind of hard since I needed to be able to store data about the previous values. As a result, I opted for a different solution, pretty inefficient but short in terms of code. I used a recursive function using the lambda in Python.</p>
<p>[code language="python"]</p>
<p>fib = lambda x:1 if x&lt;2 else fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)<br />
print(sum(filter(lambda x:x if x&lt;4000000 else 0, map(fib, [x for x in range(2, 33, 3)]))))</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>Lambda was really useful in this case because I just needed a short replacement for a function. Using this, I was able to generate all of the fibonacci numbers up to the 33rd:</p>
<p>[code language="python"]</p>
<p>map(fib, [x for x in range(2, 33, 3)])</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>As you can see here, I am iterating from 2 all the way to 33 at steps of 3. This is because I only want even valued Fibonacci and each 3rd term after the 2nd was even. 33 was selected as the lowest value where this code would work since if I chose a higher value, the runtime would be even slower due to the inefficiency of the recursive function.</p>
<p>After obtaining all of the even values, I ensure that none of them surpass 4,000,000 using this:</p>
<p>[code language="python"]</p>
<p>filter(lambda x:x if x&lt;4000000 else 0, map(fib, [x for x in range(2, 33, 3)]))</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>The filter function takes a function as the first argument and an iterable as the second. In my case, I provided another lambda function returning x if it was less than 4,000,000 and 0 if it wasn't. Afterwards, all I needed to do was take the sum of this new list using the sum function:</p>
<p>[code language="language=&quot;python"]</p>
<p>sum(filter(lambda x:x if x&lt;4000000 else 0, map(fib, [x for x in range(2, 33, 3)])))</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>And that's my solution. Hope this was clear and feel free to leave a comment about my code :)</p>
