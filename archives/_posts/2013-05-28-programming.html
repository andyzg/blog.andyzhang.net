<p>Is programming for everyone ? Is programming fun ? Is programming useful for your future ?</p>

<p>Yes, yes and YES ! Ever since the end of the 20th century, there seems to have been a decline of programmers in the world. My hypothesis is that programming became viewed as a "nerdy" thing meant for smart people and there has been a negative connotation to the words "geek" and "nerd" for the past few decades. But is it really something for geeks and nerds ?</p>
<p>In a way, programming is meant for people who are geeks and nerds but that doesn't mean everyone else can't program ! It doesn't take a genius to be able to give the computer some instructions. As futuristic the language looks, with a bit of time, anyone can be as fluent in it as they are in their mother's tongue. It just takes patience.</p>
<p>So what if someone can program though? It's not that useful, the computer already does everything you want because professionals programmed them for you, right ? Wrong. Programming is a skill that can benefit anyone on the long run. If there was one word to describe it, that word would be logic. By learning how to write code, you learn how to think in a logical sequence, making sure everything is structured, ordered and understandable by the computer's compiler. It's such a useful skill for later on because with the current hype in technology, almost everything involves computers in some way. You become an asset to employers by being able to code and that might be the deciding factor between you and another applicant when it comes to landing Â big job. When do you ever get to say that you're improving yourself by having fun (because programming is fun !)?</p>
<p>The list of pros can go on about how programming is a useful skill and the list of cons might not be able to fill a single page let alone a paragraph. All it takes is a bit of time and thinking. So if you haven't started to learn programming, search up some tutorials and teach yourself. After all, you have nothing to lose and everything to win. :)</p>
