<p>You're almost done high school/CEGEP now, you're ready to tackle university, you have amazing grades and you want to be successful. You know that you love coding and you want to continue studying what you love. So which one is a better choice ? Computer Science or Software Engineering ?</p>
<p>So is there an actual difference these two programs ? Of course there is, otherwise, why would they be called 2 different names ? I'm going to focus more on these 2 programs in University of Waterloo. I am unaware of any differences other Universities may have.</p>
<p>Computer Science is quite a prestigious at Waterloo, especially since it's known not only nationally but also from the employer's point of view. Like all Waterloo students, Computer Science students are taught to be innovative and to apply their knowledge into real life cases.  It is a part of the Faculty of Mathematics so it has a much more math intensive curriculum n on the first 2 years. As you get through the first 2 years, the courses become more flexible and you get to choose what you want to study specifically, computer related. The first 2 years of mathematics allows students to interchange between programs easily, making it a very good option for someone who is unclear of their career path. Computer Science is a much more theory based for computations unlike Software Engineering. Nonetheless, they still compete for the same jobs as Software Engineers during co-op terms.</p>
<p>Unlike Computer Science, Software Engineering is a part of both the Faculty of Mathematics and Faculty of Engineering. It is known to be one of Waterloo's most prestigious programs and is on equal caliber to some of Canada's best Engineering programs such as University of Toronto's Engineering Science. The advantage of being in Software Engineering is being able to learn not only software design and programming but also being able to broaden student's scientific knowledge on both physics and chemistry. Mathematics is obviously a given, being a subject used in almost every science there is today. It's a much more versatile program which is apparent with its large course load over the 8 study terms. The high workload obviously comes with a high reward, offering students one of the best co-op employment rates in Canada and possibly in the world. </p>
