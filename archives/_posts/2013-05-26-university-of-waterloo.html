<p>Today, I just visited Waterloo for my first time and I had a great time there. It took me a long time to get there but the transportation overall is quite convenient. I took the GO bus from the Square One station at Mississauga which brought me directly to the Davis Centre at Waterloo.</p>

<p>I started off by going to the Physical Activity Centre. There was a large amount of people coming in and out of the building, many which were actually tour guides and their group. As I walked in, I couldn't help but smile, seeing so many future Waterloo students at once and current Waterloo students and staff. One thing I couldn't help but notice was the cultural diversity. Everywhere around the building, I saw at least 5 asians pass by before I could see someone who's white. After all, this is a school that dominates in Math and Engineering, it doesn't surprise me that it attracts plenty of Asians.</p>
<p>One of the most attractive things about Waterloo is the building design. I really enjoyed walking around the campus because every building was really distinct and really contributed to the atmosphere at Waterloo. Their unique design definitely portrays Waterloo's innovative students.</p>
<p>Even as I was walking around the building, seeing each classroom and the reserved study spaces really made me want to study. I'm not sure if this is something all universities share or if Waterloo really succeeds at pushing students to do their best at school. I myself decided to settle down in a computer lab with a friend and got the chance to work a bit.</p>
<p>When I walked into an Engineering building, I wasn't surprised to see a lot of projects being worked on. There were electric cars being built by students mostly and right outside near the building, there was a racetrack where I assumed that they tested the cars or raced with them.</p>
<p>Overall, I really find the university of Waterloo a great place to be in due to its atmosphere, the welcoming students and the campus. It's going to be an exciting 5 years !</p>
