<p>24 hours ago, I could still remember myself staring at my computer, utterly lost at the code written in front of me. I was just a new programmer, having been exposed for merely a year by now. I had no idea how to do 99% of what I was expected to do at the hackathon and I just didn't know what I was doing.</p>
<p>But that's just the type of thing I like.</p>
<p>After first being introduced to programming at the beginning of 2013, I remember the first Hello World program I wrote and slowly realized that these tools provided by computer programming languages introduced me to a whole new world. And then I started programming everyday.</p>
<p>After getting more familiar with the community, I learned that people had far more experience than I did. I was 18 when I just started and most people started when they were 14-15. Since programming is a skill that comes with experience, I thought that there was no way I can be an above average programmer if everyone has so much experience, especially at Waterloo.</p>
<p>Before coming to Waterloo, I had to make a choice. What do I want ? Am I going to forever be an average programmer ? Being a competitive person, I thought that it was the last thing I'd want. I decided that nothing was going to stop me from being an above average programmer.</p>
<p>I started dedicating myself everyday, reading articles and books about programming. I realized that excuses are not a valid excuse in life. If anything, excuses are the reason you're not as good as what you want to be.</p>
<p>I started developing and developing. I learned that the best way to learn isn't just by reading but by practicing. With an amazing environment like the one University of Waterloo provides, I can easily find the motivation to work hard everyday. The first time I saw my efforts becoming fruitful was when I won 2nd place at EngHack, a local hackathon hosted at the University of Waterloo. It was an exhilarating experience and I knew I wanted to do it again.</p>
<p>I continued reading and reading, trying my best to satisfy my need for knowledge. I knew that there was no excuse for a student say he's not good because he started later. If he started later, he just needs to work twice as hard.</p>
<p>And now, all of my efforts have finally paid off. Today, at the Facebook Hackathon at the University of Waterloo, I've once again stepped out of my comfort zone to learn a new technology(Bluetooth/Server Socket Programming) and I endured it for 24 hours. My team and I built an Android application that allows you to use your phone as a trackpad for your laptop and you can add custom configurations. The final feature I added was a 4 finger tap that opened up Facebook.com.</p>
<p>After finishing all of this, I got really nervous. I wasn't able to present as well as I had hoped but I still tried my best. We still pulled through the presentation with a decent demo and walked out uncertain whether we impressed the judges.</p>
<p>And yet, 20 minutes later, we heard our names being called out for being 1st place at the Facebook Hackathon. In just one second, I had to take in the fact that not only I am first place, but I am first place at a FACEBOOK Hackathon. I literally felt my head explode, jumping with excitement and hugged my team mates. It was the greatest experience of my life.</p>
<p>After this one year of programming craziness, I learned that you should never be discouraged if you fall behind. Hard work pays off and with a little bit of self motivation, anything is possible.</p>
