Improving life. Because it's worth it
====================================

<!-- TODO: Replace this header -->
There's nothing better than saying that you're happy with your life. It's
something to be proud of, and it's something worth striving for.

I've been looking for different ways to incrementally improve how I treat
myself, and how I can make myself a better person. I wanted to share these
ideas with you in this post.

## Stay focused

Before university, I was told to have an open mind and try as many things
as I can. I thought that I should take every opportunity I could, and
commit to as many things as I could. It was obvious to me that that's what
would've made me a more interesting person, a more respectable person and
especially a smarter person.

And that's what I did. I joined the rowing team as well as the dragon boat team,
I was the VP of Finance for the student council, programmer on Robotics team,
percussionist and pianist for an orchestra. And I was really proud.

In hindsight, I shouldn't have been proud at all. I didn't put half the effort
I had planned for VP Finance, I rarely showed up to rowing practices, and I
never helped fundraising for dragonboat. And I always messed up my parts
during orchestra concerts.

I did learn a lot of valuable lessons from that year.

Trying something completely new is really and it's always tempting to want
to commit. I felt the same way before every one of my commitments. But before
you agree to commit, ask yourself whether you can commit to this. That
you're willing to commit even during exam weeks, or when all of your friends
are going out and you can't go. And trust me, making this decision sucks, and
it happens all the time.

Instead, choose commitments that you'd do over everything else. If you want to
try something new, by all means. But if it can become a long term commitment,
be mindful about how it can suck up all of your free time. Don't do this to
your future self. Instead, make your future self thank your decisions today.

## Stay foolish

"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."

Before university, I hated assignments. Especially when I did not do well on
them and it happened very often. But I started realizing that I gained more
from getting a bad mark.

As counter intuitive as this sounds, it actually benefited me when I got bad
grades. The reason why was because I learned where my mistakes were, and I
knew the flaws of my thought process when I tried solving the problem. So
when it came down to the final exam, I knew what not to do.

I learned that mistakes are probably your greatest tools to learn. After all,
no one ever learned anything from always being right. But more importantly,
it's about your mentality when mistakes happen. You should always embrace
these mistakes as a part of a learning process.

Ever since I've adapted this mentality, I've always viewed mistakes and negative
experiences in a different way. I try to identify what caused the experience
and how to fix or how to prevent it from happening again. And I can guarantee
you that this is better than dwelling on the thought of a mistake or a negative
experience.

Keeping this mentality has kept me more positive about my mistakes and errors,
and it gives me happiness to know that I've learned something new. Who knew a
mistake could make someone happy?


## Stay happy

*Points to cover*
- Surround yourself with good people
- Keep memories, either by photos or videos or notes
- Stay healthy
- See the positive side in things

You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. If you want
to be happy in life, then surround yourself with happy people. These people
will bring positivity in your life and will bring you up during your worst days.

And make sure your moments with your friends aren't forgotten. Take photos, videos,
capture everything that you can so that you don't forget. Reliving them in the
future is something you can never thank yourself enough of.

In addition to taking videos and photos, I've found another method of staying
happy. I've been taking notes every day about what I did during my day that was
either productive or happy. It makes me proud of what I have done every day
and also reading back makes me realize how fun of a semester I have had.

And last but not least, see the positive side in things. It's so easy to fall
into a negative mentality but by changing your mentality to seeing the light in
everything, it makes you more thankful and appreciative of every moment. For
example, if someone is giving you constructive criticism, it's important to
know that they're trying to help you as opposed to implying you're bad by
pointing out all of your mistakes and flaws. People should always assume that
others have good intentions unless proven wrong.

## Closing thoughts
