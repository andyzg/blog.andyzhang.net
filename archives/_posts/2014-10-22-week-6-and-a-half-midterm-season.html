<p>It just hit me today that I can't do what I used to do - cram everything into a day and hope to get a good grade.</p>

<p>For almost every course I've taken in University so far, I've been able to cram everything into a few hours and still pull off a good grade. Today was the first time I wasn't able to and it reminded me that I need to work hard at school and that I can't slack off.</p>
<p>In other words, today, I've failed. I've been so used to success for the last year that today's failure just reminded me how seriously I should take university and how nothing is easy in school and in life. Everything has to be earned and grades are no exception. Over the past week, I've been fairly busy, coming back from California and then going back to Montreal to get my medical card renewed -- there was no other option since Thanksgiving was completely booked.</p>
<p>There's a lot on my plate right now and I'm really scared of half assing those tasks but at this point, I will be. It's gotten to a point where I'm going to need to choose between grades and extra curriculars and I'm certainly not willing to sacrifice my grades so unfortunately, my commitment to organizing things will be minimal until I have less things to worry about.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's not happening anytime soon. From the looks of my schedule, I have a CS midterm this week as well as a few more assignments. Luckily, I got a head start due to my motivation from that past failure. Next week, I have 2 more exams as well as the usual assignments and lab. Here's my biggest fear: I'm missing 2 weeks of school right after next week because I'm going to Europe for a tech conference and then I'll be going to the Facebook Global Hackathon. And I'm still going to find time during those events to do my assignments and somehow hand them in remotely, likely by LaTeX.</p>
<p>The good news is that the job search is done and my options are now narrowed down to Google Montreal and Coursera.  I really want Coursera but I also really want to live at home for a term. The learning potential in both is huge as well as the opportunity and fun. It's a first world problem to face this difficult decision but hey, it doesn't mean I don't deserve to have a problem.</p>
