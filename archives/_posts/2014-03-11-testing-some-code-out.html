<address>I think it's about time I start acting a bit more like a future Software Engineer and start talking about some code. Let's give it a shot!</address>
<address>One thing I love to do is to use Python to help me do my homework. There are only a few cases when I can use it but this example is one of those where I fell in love with Python.</address>
<address>[code language="python"]<br />
from fractions import gcd<br />
gcd(31415, 314)<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Now how in the world is this useful? In my Math 135 class, sometimes, we're given problems involving a bunch of modulus and congruences. I kind of want to verify my answer so for example, one of my questions was to find the remainder of 314^420/1001. What did I do? Well, all I did was just do the modulus of the number. Pretty straightforward in python, pretty long using math</p>
<p>[code language="python"]<br />
def getRemainder(base, exponent, dividend):<br />
	number = base ** exponent<br />
	return number % dividend<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And that's pretty much how I do a lot of my Math homework. It's fun being able to apply some programming knowledge to assist my schoolwork in different subjects. You have a computer since you're reading this, might as well make use if it's power :)
