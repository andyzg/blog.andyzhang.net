<p>For personal purposes once again, I'd like to keep track and also share a timeline of my coding projects and experiences in a bullet point fashion. It's awesome seeing the incremental steps I'm taking to becoming a better programmer and since it's still fresh in my mind, I'd like to keep this as a token of memory.</p>

<p>November 2012</p>
<p>I was a part of my school's Robotics Team and really wanted to learn how to code! So I got my set up ready using RobotC and looked at the code for the previous years. Based on that, I saw a pattern on how code worked and did my best writing code for the robot. I started off with writing basic movements for the robot and then incrementally increasing the amount of ports used.</p>
<p>By February 2013, I had completed my first real program. With the help of a friend, I wrote the drive system for the robot. It essentially received input from the microcontroller and based on those inputs, it moves based on the written logic of the code. The second part was the autonomous code where from a while loop, it continuously performed certain actions for the Programming Competition.</p>

<p>January 2013</p>
<p>I just bought Java for Dummies and I wanted to start picking up the language. While reading through it, I thought it was a great opportunity to do Project Euler problems to get familiar with how everything worked. I started learning by doing and became pretty comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Another mini project was my friend wanted to make a program that we could put at our kiosk for the Robotics Competition. It was a way to track all of the free cupcakes we'd give out. I remember I stayed up until 4am figuring it out(first time staying up that late for programming) and managing to store all of the names in a file and then rereading it. Thinking back on it, that was a terrible piece of code. But it sorta worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>March 2013</p>
<p>I decided to upgrade my R-Score calculator into something with a much better GUI. I opted for a website and built my first official static website using JQuery, HTML and CSS. It would take the person's grades and display their R-Score and programs they were eligible for in Quebec universities. And no, unfortunately, the data was not scraped off the web....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 2013</p>
<p>I slowly started picking up some Python. Again, I thought it would be cool to learn it by applying it and my friend just showed me a cool game he made with Python using PyGame. I decided to build something similar, but it ended up being a game where I run around trying to avoid bullets. It was a cool game when I think back on it.</p>
<p>June 2013</p>
<p>I thought that I was pretty good at programming and I decided to do my first real big project! I realized a lot of people had difficulty with physics so I wanted to create a web platform that allows students to practice problems. It was where I first started with PHP and I learned about SQL, queries, running a local server and different types of HTTP requests. I had the basic website done with registration and I learned a lot from it. I ended up stopping this project since I realized I wanted to spend my last summer having fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>September 2013</p>
<p>Just got to Waterloo! Made plenty of friends and decided I wanted to build projects with them! We played a pretty cool game called Ultimate Tic Tac Toe during Orientation Week and I wanted to rebuild an app for it on Android. This project was one of my first real Android apps and I learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>October 2013</p>
<p>I discovered what info sessions were at Waterloo and really wanted to have them conveniently stored on my phone as a Google Calendar event... I made myself a web scraper app that parses the data from the info session calendar and creates a calendar for me. It kinda worked :)</p>
<p>I also attended my first hacking event where I helped my friend build a GUI for his Chrome extension that blocks websites. It was pretty cool seeing everything getting pieced together and I also started getting the hang of Git.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>November 2013</p>
<p>I went to my first Hackathon that month! EngHack was a great success and I wanted to address the problem with WatCard balances. It was really tedious constantly going online to check how much money I had so we made an app that scrapes all of that data for us in 1 click after logging in. It was really neat being able to shorten a manual process for everyone and I really felt like it did have an impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>December 2013</p>
<p>I thought that I should make my own website. So I did. I made my own design from scratch and I thought it looked really neat, especially since it was all done in a week. I also spent my time learning a lot of NodeJS at this point, reading through different tutorials and articles on what's so good about it. I spent some of that time writing a Blog from scratch through a tutorial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>January 2014</p>
<p>When I came back to school, I went back to SE HackDay, where I wanted to create an app called Duel. It would be a more entertaining way to do problems where you would compete with the other person. I ended up not getting so far because I was absolutely clueless on how to use the MEAN stack. AngularJS was what bothered me the most but I definitely do think I learned a lot from this.</p>
<p>The weekend after, I wanted to create a real time scheduling tool for students as a web app. Again, I tackled the MEAN stack as a solo project at MHacks and didn't get too far with it since I worked alone on the project. I managed to build a registration system using MongoDB, some UI using BootStrap, a chat box with Sockets and a bunch of other stuff. Overall, I can definitely say that this was a huge learning experience for me.</p>
<p>The weekend after(I know, I went crazy for 3 weekends), I went to the Facebook Hackathon. We wanted to be able to create a free app that connects our android device to a windows machine and controls its mouse. So we did it. I encountered a lot of difficulties but it ended up not being so bad. At this point, I became much more comfortable with Git(without even realizing it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>February 2014</p>
<p>Thanks to an awesome upper year, I was brought into the open source world where all of the code is online. I made my first real open source contribution through there and did get to see an impact I had on a website. I found this to be extremely rewarding and wanted to do it again. However, I ended up having some personal issues which led to a break in programming for myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>March 2014</p>
<p>I went to hack Waterloo, wanting to build something in less than 2 hours. I wanted to be able to answer: What's a cooler word? X or Y? So I used Twitter's API to check the frequency of 2 different words and managed to build it in 2 hours, with an extra hour to deploy it on Heroku.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 2014</p>
<p>Now that most of my time is freed up, I'm mostly going to be working on OnePanel now, a project some Software Engineering students and I have been working on for a month. We're finally seeing some great progress and I'm hopefully going to complete my portion of the Android code soon enough.</p>
