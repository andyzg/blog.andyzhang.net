<img class="size-full wp-image alignleft" id="i-25" alt="Image" src="http://andyzhang1.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/unnamed.png" width="336" height="336" /><p>I recentlyÂ got this phone around a month ago and I am extremely satisfied with it. Being a previous iPhone user, it took a day or 2 to get used to the interface of this phone but as I got the hang of it, it seemed like an improved interface compared to the iPhone. The iPhone has a simple layout where there are 4 columns of icons in 4-5 rows, depending on the version of the iPhone. As for the Google Nexus 4, it is a slight bit more complicated where there are 2 different menus. The first menu which features a personalized background contains all of the widgets and apps that are "favourited" by the user. In the second menu, all of the apps are compressed into a grid. Although it can be longer to find the app you're looking for, it's easy to simply transport it to the first menu. There are also widgets that can be placed into the first menu, a feature that really got me into the Google Nexus 4. It helps me stay organized and see all of the information I want when I open my phone.</p>
<p>The performance on this phone was not a disappointment. Running on a 2GB RAM, this phone really performed all of the tasks quickly and possibly even faster than the iPhone 4S. However, there are a few apps that crash more frequently than the iPhone and that is definitely something that could be improved on.</p>
<p>I haven't had the chance to use its camera too much as I am not a big fan of photos. However, I do like the built in filters provided in the Gallery app of the phone. This allows the user to easily edit the picture with a variety of filters. The camera also offers much more options when it comes to using the built in camera such as reducing the picture's size.</p>
<p>Overall, I am extremely satisfied and with the price that is currently on the market, it is a must buy for anyone who seeks a high caliber performance under a limited budget.</p>
