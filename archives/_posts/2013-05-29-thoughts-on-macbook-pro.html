<p>There was always this one point in our life where we heard of a debate between Macbooks and PCs. I've used both systems for over several months and had a fair share of their problems and their advantages. I thought I'd post my thoughts on the current Macbook I use first since I have been using it much more frequently.</p>
<p>First of all, there's an underlying assumption that Macbooks are lighter because they seem more slim. That's false. I was also under this false impression until I became a Macbook user and realized that its weight wasn't so far away from my Lenovo IdeaPad Y560. Aesthetically, it seems much nicer for sure and its compact look can definitely lead on people to buying this system.</p>
<p>Apart from its weight, I am not a very huge fan of the temperature on the sides of its keyboard. I never had this problem with PCs because they have a ventilation system allowing the system to release heat from a specific part of the laptop. On the Macbook, I get this impression that all of the heat is released through the surface of the keyboard which really heats up my wrists as I am typing. This definitely can be comfortable during cold seasons but as this is not something under the user's control, it needs to be looked into.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Macbook offers a really fast performance including a fast boot-up. That was one problem I had with my Lenovo laptop and it was fixed when I started using my macbook. When I reopen my Macbook, I can easily start working on it again in less than 5 seconds whereas for PCs, it takes quite a while before I can actually work again. That was one of my main issues with my previous laptop and it is definitely a huge plus when working with a Macbook.</p>
<p>I do like how the desktop is managed and how you can swipe through different windows easily using the trackpad. It really makes browsing and multitasking much easier without a mouse. In fact, I find working with a mouse slower than working with the trackpad because the trackpad is honestly the most addicting part of a Macbook. With its smooth feel, its definitely one of the main reasons I would buy a Macbook.</p>
<p>The real question now is if it is worth paying so much just for something different. I am a strong believer of getting your money's worth but in this case, the Macbook is definitely not worth the few extra hundreds. Its retail value is beyond reasonable and I would not have gotten one if my brother never gave me his old one.</p>
<p>However, if you're looking for something with durable hardware and a solid performance, Macbook is definitely right for you. With its smooth trackpad and its unique interface, you will definitely be ale to find what you need in this laptop.</p>
