<p>Hey !</p>

<p>I'm finally done the hectic first round of interviews! Reading week has just started and I feel so relieved being able to not worry about an assignment due in 2 hours or having an interview the next morning. I'm really excited for a lot of things during reading week. A friend and I have decided to work on a completely new project and we're going to start on it this week. It's an idea inspired from my Facebook Hackathon project and I really like it so I do plan on pursuing it.</p>
<p>I'm lucky enough to say that I had more than a handful of interviews over the past few weeks. A few interviewers have viewed my resume as being unique and making me seem very passionate(which I am 200%) among the first year candidates and I wanted to share how I design my resume in order to convey this impression. For more details on this, feel free to check out my post below but if you'd like the gist of it, here it is:</p>
<p>Templates are a no no for me. You would just be another hay in a haystack, meaning they will forget about you. I like to design my own resume and make sure that I make use of all of its space without cramming it, all in 1 page. Why 1 page? This is because this shows that you are able to prioritize information. If you aren't able to prioritize for your resume, it can depict a lot about who you are in real life.</p>
<p>Content is also really important. If you are really passionate about software, this shouldn't be a problem for you. You should have projects all over your resume as a first year and talk about what they are and what you did.</p>
<p>I also like to add colours to mine because I find it makes my resume stand out. Most employers do notice these differences and it can also make your resume more fun to read.</p>
<p>Overall, it's really important to put a lot of work in your resume. I highly encourage future applicants to do the same and make sure that it looks nice, the content is good and that it gets reviewed.</p>
<p>Next week, I am finally going to be able to return to Montreal. I'll be doing a couple of medical appointments and also visiting my old school, Marianopolis. I had an amazing experience there and I really want to relive some of my memories there and visit some friends. One of my favourite is the Canadian Robotics Competition and it's starting next Thursday. I was lucky enough to be last year's winner along with my team and this year, the bar is set high for them!</p>
<p>There's so much I want to talk about but I would prefer saving it for another post. It seems like my post get more and more unstructured as I write down my trail of thoughts. We'll see how this ends up being in a few months.</p>
<p>Later world !</p>
