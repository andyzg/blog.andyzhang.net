<p>Hello!</p>

<p>First week of school was awesome. But unfortunately, not awesome enough for me to go to class. Yes, I've already started skipping class, it's terrible but I'm at least keeping up with my notes. I've done most of my assignments already and have been focusing on other stuff.</p>
<p>For example, Wednesday, there was a Software meetup where our class got the chance to meet every other class. Monday, I went out with my friends to Ben Thanh for dinner to celebrate my birthday and it was a lot of fun. We then played some Resistance which is always a guaranteed night of fun!</p>
<p>Tuesday night, I ran to the gym and tried to do a 2km on the ergo machine. I felt really sick afterwards but I'm glad I was able to finish it since it was extremely challenging. My time was okay(8:14), much better than my first time but nowhere near my record. All the more reason to get back in shape! I also booked my tickets to the Facebook Hackathon in November. Really hyped up for that!</p>
<p>Thursday, I had resume critiques. It was really busy, and there were over 100 first years looking to get their resumes critiqued. The event went very well and generally, people were really happy with the feedback they received. It's good to see that they're seeking early help for their resume since the feedback from upper years is really really valuable for the job search.</p>
<p>On Friday and Saturday, I was with my parents and we went shopping for groceries and they also dropped off some stuff for me. We went to a Chinese restaurant in Markham and bought a really freshly cooked fish and it tasted really good. I also gave my mom my old computer, after erasing all of my old stuff.</p>
<p>Saturday, I finally bought rock climbing shoes. After coming back from Toronto, we went to eat dinner at My Thai with 48 students from Software Engineering! It was great seeing everyone again and seeing that everyone is having fun. We then went to my friend's place to play some Super Smash and I even got to try the new Super Smash on the Nintendo 3Ds.</p>
<p>Sunday, I attended the Super Smash Collegiate tryouts and got my ass completely whooped. It was really fun regardless considering I haven't played the game in so long. After coming back, I cooked with my roommate and then started preparing for another awesome week :)</p>
