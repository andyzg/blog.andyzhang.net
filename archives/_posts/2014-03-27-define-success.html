<p>According to an online dictionary, success is defined as: the favorable or prosperous termination of attempts or endeavors; the accomplishment of one's goals. So what's your goal?</p>
<p>For the past few years, I've always had the belief that being rich, recognized and talented was being successful. Being known as the best and having all the money you want. Being a person others would talk about, admire. But really, is that really success?</p>
<p>It's common to define such a life as success but what's ignored is the life of such a person. But here's some knowledge a speaker once shared with me: being CEO is the loneliest job ever. But why?</p>
<p>Okay, maybe you don't have to be a CEO to be rich. But what I'm trying to say is that there's always sacrifice when you want something so bad. Consequently, having such a successful career may have an impact on your personal life.</p>
<p>I once talked with a friend who I asked: what do you want to do in the future? He told me he just wanted to be happy, find a comfortable job and just enjoy life. I told him I wanted to start a company, live the dangerous life and risk everything to become successful. But when you reach success, how happy will you be?</p>
<p>Here's another way to view it. Like the chicken and the egg, what comes first? Success or happiness? Does success imply happiness or does happiness imply success? One thing is certain and that's the fact that success does not always imply happiness. It does imply a lot of hard work. But if you had the choice to spend all of your free time on your road to success, how happy will you be in the end? You can definitely be happy when all of your friends congratulate you. But in a week, are you really that much happier?</p>
<p>So what am I really trying to say? The above all seems really abstract but all I want to say is that being happy should be the most important thing in life. Chances are, if you're reading this, you already have access to internet, something that only privileged people get. You should enjoy what you have and really try to be as happy as possible about what you have and not what you don't have. You should work towards not success, but what you think would be a happy life.</p>
<p>I want to start changing my goals from here on. I don't want to work towards success any more, but rather work towards happiness. In 10 years, I want to be able to wake up and say that today is going to be a fun day of work because I enjoy what I do and what I have.  I want to be able to say that it doesn't matter what I didn't achieve, what matters is what I did and what I have. You only live for such a short amount of time so you should spend this time enjoying what you can achieve and not what you could've achieved.</p>
