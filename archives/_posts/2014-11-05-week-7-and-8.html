<p>It's been so crazy, these last few days. I've been so focused on school and my extra curricular and yet I'm still falling behind, truth to be told. For example, I've missed some important events as an Engineering Ambassadors. I'm pretty shameful about that.</p>
<p>I've also been helping out on the WEC Programming Competition and EngHack which took a lot of my time. I tried my best to help out on those and managed to contribute quite a bit. It was mainly the homework that were killer. I had plenty of assignments to do, many which were for this week as well as last weeks. The reason for this was because I am in Dublin and London for the first week of November. And let me tell you all about it.</p>
<p>After arriving in London, it was 6AM. It was an unpleasant red eye flight and unfortunately there was no way around it. I was traveling around a hop on hop off Golden Bus Tour around London, getting to see many of the major attractions such as the London Tower and the castle where Queen Elizabeth lives in. It was pretty cool. We were also traveling around Picadilly and other parts of downtown, seeing a lot of London. What I can't get enough of is the London accent. Kills me every time, I die of jealousy.</p>
<p>In Dublin, it's been the craziest time ever. After arriving, I unfortunately had to catch up on a ton of homework but afterwards, in the conference, I got to meet the most amazing people ever. And I mean it when I say that. There's never a point in my life where I've met so much diversity in one place, especially all students. People from all over the world gathered to attend this event and meet each other. It's great to meet like minded people and people from all sorts of disciplines such as business, environmental, medical, science, etc.</p>
<p>During the conference, we had the chance to see Drew Houston, Brendan Iribe, Tony Fadell, and many more. So many legendary innovators have gathered to this event and it's amazing to see this huge conference put together. Hands down for an amazing job by the organizers.</p>
<p>I've also had the chance to try some of Dublin's delicacies, mainly its Irish beer. Guinness is simply golden here, by far the best beer I've had in my life. I've also had some cottage pie and many other things to taste during my stay so far.</p>
<p>I'm halfway through my time here so far, so I hope the rest is just as good as the first half. Cheers!</p>
