<p>I'm slowly preparing for my studies at University of Waterloo and I am far too excited at the moment. One of the greatest things at Waterloo is the cooperative education program and I have been focusing mainly on building my portfolio in order to showcase projects that are representative of my motivation and abilities.</p>

<p>One of the main projects I've been recently working on is a website called Friendwork. The urban dictionary definition : </p>
<table id="entries">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td id="entry_6057478" colspan="3">
<div>Like teamwork, but only really good friends are capable of completing a task and are able to call it "friend work". Usually results in a high-five.</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The goal of this website is to give free practice problems to students so that they can get a better understanding of the subject. Many current students have difficulty passing physics courses, notably Electricity and Magnetism and I thought it would be a great idea to combine the student's motivation and these resources in order to raise their chances of excelling in the course. There will also be extra features such as exam simulation, ratings for each problem, etc.</p>
<p>I'm writing this website using HTML, CSS, JQuery, Javascript, PHP and SQL at the moment. I've been using XAMPP to run my PHP scripts and to store data in its offline database. </p>
<p>Hopefully when it's released by the end of the summer, it can help students out :)</p>
