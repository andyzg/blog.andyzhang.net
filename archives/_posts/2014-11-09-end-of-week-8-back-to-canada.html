<p>The first half of my Europe trip was pretty awesome. Happy to say that the second half was just as awesome.</p>
<p>Let's start with what happened on Wednesday. During the day time, I slept in, and had spent a lot of my time doing my CS241 assignment. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get through the release tests, only getting 9/28. But no big deal, a big day awaited me. After getting to RDS(Royal Dublin Society), I immediately met up with a couple of friends and headed to the food summit. I got to try out some salmon, bread, curry, cheese and chutney. It was a great meal, I was feeling energized!</p>
<p>We then headed to a photo shoot which was pretty cool, got a couple of cool head shots. Then the night began. We were at the Jameson's pub at Herbert Park and had free tickets for drinks. I got to try out some Jameson whiskey in the country where it all started. Later that night, we headed back to the hotel.</p>
<p>It was 9:30 and I realized it was actually 4:30 in Waterloo. I had 30 minutes left to do my CS assignment. With a couple of modifications and testing, I realized I was running out of time. And then a clutch finish, I ended up somehow from 9/28 to 28/28. These are the moments I live for in CS, although I hate the fact I can't explain why. We then headed to Mercantile, a pub sponsored by Sales Force and had the most amazing time ever, hunting down my look alike and then meeting the OnePlus founder and grabbing some drunk food at McDonald.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I had a fairly late wake up. On my way there, the cab driver was super nice, explaining to me a lot of the buildings around Dublin and what kind of city it is. Over there, I got to try out the Oculus Rift again in an Audi. We then headed for some lunch. Afterwards, I went to the main stage, seeing some of the pitches from the PITCH competition. I also met up with Danae Ringelmann, CEO and Founder of Indiegogo and had a cool chat. I was just trying to sell her Jobmine, to be honest. Would love to have her on the system.</p>
<p>After that, there were a couple more speakers. Peter Thiel and Bono. Hell yeah, that was amazing as well. Okay I lied, I felt like I was focused more on the fact that I was listening to them speak rather than learning and understanding what they were saying. Needless to asay I had a good time.</p>
<p>That evening, it was the huge food summit at Herbert park once again. I had the chance to try all sorts of food, truffles, macaroons, spaghetti, all sorts of stuff. Great food, great alcohol, would go again. After we headed back, we all met up at 10 to go to Opium for the next Night Summit. It was raining really hard, and the venue was full so we ended up eating at a Japanese place nearby. Near 12:30, after the venue cleared up, we went in and had an amazing night, dancing and chatting.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I toured Dublin, got to see the Guinness Storehouse and Trinity College. We went around Dublin through the Hop on Hop off and got to see a lot of the city's beauty. On Sunday, we took a day trip all the way to Cliffs of Moher, where Harry Potter was filmed. It was a breathtaking view and I took a lot of pictures there. At night, after we got back, we ate at a place called Crackbird. The chicken breasts were amazing but we got caught off guard and ordered a bit too much...</p>
<p>That was the end of my Europe Trip! Good time :)</p>
