<p>Okay, not really halfway. But for me, it felt like it since it's midterm season.</p>

<p>I'm in the middle of my co-op applications and it's been a really stressful few weeks. Interview here, lab there, midterm tomorrow night and you don't remember the last time you went to class. Great.</p>
<p>Good news is, I'm getting closer and closer to reading week. (*super exciting dance*). It's really hard to imagine how life is going to be like for the next 5 years since I won't be having any long breaks due to coop. A weekend is quite a luxury and a week off is better than a gift from God. There are so many projects I was thinking on working on, mainly ScheduleDirect and UWFlow.com. I've been in contact with a startup in Montreal and I've offered to contribute to their current project that I won't disclose immediately. I'm going to start working with them around March and I think it's going to be a very exciting experience working for someone remotely.</p>
<p>I've started playing around with some code with UWFlow and it's really intimidating, I must say. As someone who's never had any prior internships before, it is really amazing how such huge code bases are designed and well structured(well, this one is at least :P). It's one of my favourite parts about Software development: it's challenging and it requires design. I'm first starting off with fixing tiny little bugs and I'm slowly going to dig into the code base and try to tackle bigger and bigger projects for the website.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of personal projects, I have tons in my mind but mainly one I will probably focus on. I'm planning on refactoring all of my code for DroidPad, the Android Application that won 1st place at the Facebook Hackathon. My team and I are planning on improving it and actually shipping it to the public so that everyone can benefit from it too. It is currently usable but not convenient to set up which really ruins its whole purpose since it's meant to be convenient in all ways. As a result, we're going to rebuild it and make it easier to use so that even a 5 year old can use it easily!</p>
<p>But these are really all projects that I'm thinking of working on after I'm done midterms and my coop applications. I'm really excited to know which company I'll be spending my summer with, the suspense is killing me !</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to wait to find out. #excited.</p>
<p>Night world.</p>
