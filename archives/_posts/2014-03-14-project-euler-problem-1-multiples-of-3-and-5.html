<p>I've decided to start a series of Project Euler problems on this blog because this is where I first started applying my programming knowledge. I'm a huge believer of applying what you know and Project Euler gives me the opportunity to not only practice my programming skills but also to come up with new algorithms. So without further due, let's get started.</p>
<p>"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."</p>
<p>My challenge for this series of Project Euler post is to solve the problems in the smallest amount of code. First problem wasn't too hard, just a simple for loop appending numbers to a list if they are divisible by 3 or 5.</p>
<p>[code language="python"]<br />
print(sum([x if x%3 == 0 or x%5 == 0 else 0 for x in xrange(0, 1000)]))<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Let me break this solution down step by step.<br />
Since we have the constraint of all the numbers under 1000, I decided to use a for loop to iterator through all of the numbers:</p>
<p>[code language="python"]<br />
for x in xrange(0, 1000)<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Since I only wanted those that are divisible by 3 or 5, I need an if else condition.</p>
<p>[code language="python"]<br />
x if x%3 == 0 or x%5 == 0<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Now I needed to somehow find the sum of all of these elements. I decided to use the built in Python function sum(). However, this requires a list as an argument, so I use brackets to wrap my numbers into a list.</p>
<p>[code language="python"]<br />
sum([x if x%3 == 0 or x%5 == 0 for x in xrange(0, 1000)])<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And there you have it! My solution for Project Euler problem 1! Hope you enjoyed it:)</p>
