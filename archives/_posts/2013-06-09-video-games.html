<p>In CEGEP, I had a course called Video Games during my 4th semester and I do feel as if I have learned a lot from it. Yes, a video game is a video game but it's not only that. It's a business for the developers, it's a way to socialize for the gamers, it's a way to learn how the economy works in real life. And most of all, it's known to be fun.</p>
<p>Some might argue that video games is a waste of time and in a sense, they are correct. It's strange to see that many are convinced that it's a waste of time including the gamers themselves but on the same token, many also think it's worth their time. So who is right?</p>
<p>I hate to be the devil's advocate but video games isn't the most time efficient activity there is. And why ? Well there are many reasons that could support my argument such as physical health, education, addiction, social life and even priorities. </p>
<p>First of all, physical health should definitely be a priority for people of all ages, including teenagers. Fun fact: Video games burn on average 81.5 calories an hour according to a study conducted by Lorraine Lanningham-Foster in 2009. This is nowhere near the few hundred calories burnt per hour from sports. Yes, gaming at least burns calories but even painting uses at least 3 times more calories than gaming. Gamers are often also sedentary due to their long sessions which cause them to be inactive for whole days without stopping. With their game as a distraction, this can disrupt their food schedule and often leave them unconsciously starving for hours. With this being repeated many times throughout their youth, there is no doubt that this can cause health related issues in the future where the consequences of their actions hurt the most. Also, to maintain a healthy lifestyle, it is recommended to do physical activity at least 2-3 times a week. Obviously, gaming is not a physical activity despite burning a little below 100 calories an hour and it requires an actual sport or a cardiovascular exercise or just working out. As games become more addicting, gamers tend procrastinate their fitness schedule and can gradually suffer on the long run.</p>
<p>It's not only the physical health that suffers but also the gamer's career and education. It is true that some games can be very educative but it is nowhere near the amount you can learn from a book. In fact, sometimes, the information you get from the game can be flawed. For example, if someone were to play God of War, they may think that they're learning Greek Mythology. Unless they knew prior to playing, God of War does not depict Greek Mythology exactly and it would not be as accurate as the book. Game developers reshape their game so that it appeals to their targeted audience, not so that they learn a lot. Also, unless you have the potential to become a Major League Gamer, video games doesn't help your career at all. This remains the same with many other hobbies and many would say the same about sports which is perfectly understandable. The same could be said that sports have much more benefits than video games which is why sports are much more encouraged.</p>
<p>This paragraph, I promise you will be short. Video games are often addicting. Video games are not beneficial. Video gamers are addicted to something that isn't beneficial. Video games are as a result bad. </p>
<p>Many might argue that video games have helped them get friends and even close friends. With a common interest, it doesn't surprise me that they get along fine. However, video games is an activity that is played online which removes the "real world socialization" and includes the "virtual world socialization". Let me make an analogy with this. When you go hang out with a friend and grab a coffee with them and share a nice conversation, isn't it much more friendly than through Facebook chat? I feel as though there's a better friendship being built when an actual conversation is made whereas in video games, the interactiveness is solely on the game. Although it could be said the same for sports, they are all reunited in the physical world which allows them to socialize afterwards and such. I often see sports banquets and victory suppers happen in sports teams but for some reason, I never see victory suppers from LoL gamers every time they win a game.</p>
<p>It's obvious that in life, we have a list of priorities that should never be forgotten: Family, Health, School, Friends, Extracurricular Activities(list for students). For some reason, today, it isn't uncommon to see someone dropping several classes at school just because of their video game. It's weird to think that video games climbed the priorities list to surpass school which is the equivalent to their future career and even health which often happens. I'm sure everyone knows a girl that was dumped because their ex-boyfriend wanted to play games rather than date that girl. All of this because video games tend to be very addicting which is quite dangerous I must say.</p>
<p>So why play video games? A get together with friends ? Perfectly understandable. To "socialize" and to "learn"? Go play some sports and go read a book. </p>
